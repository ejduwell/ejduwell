   TextyBeast is a Python and Bash repository for scraping both spoken and written text from video 
   image frames and audio using AI detection, recognition, and transcription models and functions 
   from MMOCR, OpenAI's Whisper, and Pyannote. 
    
   This repository was developed to scrape text data from video recorded lectures and classroom 
   sessions in an effort to provide low-level data describing spoken and written information within 
   a course/curriculum for educational research and curricular development. This is it's intended 
   use case, but it could could be used for other applications as well. 

   TextyBeast can be configured to run jobs locally, remotely (including SLURM clusters), or both.
